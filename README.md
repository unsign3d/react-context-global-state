# React context as a global state manager

## Why

Just for the lulz

## What

This is the code that will be explained in a medium article in my blog

## TL;DR

- AppContext.js declares a context provider and a context consumer, the context provider also has a state and a function to update the state

- connect.js provides a simple api for forgetting about the internal of the context and just connect a component to the global state

- Cat and Dog are consumer to the state, index.js is the "connect" and Cat/Dog.js are stateless component

- ChangeFamily shows how to change the global state
